### To install packages
Basic Chocolatey Commands
We use the choco command to run chocolatey. (Remember, you must use an administrative shell for it to work.)

Install a new package:
```
choco install filename
```
Remove a package:
```
choco uninstall filename
```
List all of the installed packages:
```
choco list
```
Update:
```
choco upgrade filename
```
or to update everything at once:
```
choco upgrade all
```
